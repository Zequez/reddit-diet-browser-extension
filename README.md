# Reddit Diet Browser Extension

This is the [Reddit Diet](https://github.com/Zequez/reddit-diet) browser extension.
It allows you to bypass the security that doesn't allow Reddit to be embedded
in another website.

You can access Reddit Diet on the web at [redditdiet.zequez.com](https://redditdiet.zequez.com/),
kindly statically hosted by Github Pages. (you still need to install the extension for the embedded Reddit posts to work)
